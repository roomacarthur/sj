They are totally reliable and the work was done to the highest standard, both wallpapering and painting. Four years later the house is still in perfect condition.

Not only do they achieve high quality work that is so evident in the finished look, it is their knowledge, helpfulness and can do attitude that is so vital in achieving the right outcomes. Both work with you at every level and that is what makes them so much more than just professional painters. Add to that their joyful characters and sense of humour, and you have the perfect balance”",

I never have to worry about the positioning of a motif on a wallpaper, Jim will already have thought that through and planned it out. The key is in the preparation for each room, and the quality of the finish is fantastic. He is also totally reliable and a joy to have around. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending him. As a recent client said, "Jim is the Aston Martin of decorators"”',

Critically, they invest a massive amount of time in the preparation of a job, which is the only way to deliver top class results which stand the test of time. As an added bonus, they are also lovely people to have around, I cannot recommend them highly enough.”",
